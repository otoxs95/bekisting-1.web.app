I wouldn&#039;t use stainless there either as it&#039;s not graded and i don&#039;t trust it at high torque. But, i have found that they are also a fine thread. I&#039;ve tried pb and some heat to no avail and the control arms are now getting a little rounded from the 13mm slipping. 19mm is a bit loose and 18 mm is too small etc. I am replacing the lbjs and inner and outer tie rods and i can&#039;t get the jam nut on the drivers side to break free. The inner tie rod can be rotated back in place with a 14mm open end 8. 16:05 lowrangeoffroad 486 606 просмотров. When loosening the jam nut, the inner tie rod will more than likely rotate with the nut. So need some big and small adjustable wrenches for this kind of job. 2:13 cody the car guy 27 500 просмотров. Spin on the new tie rod using the number of turns counted from removing the old tie rod. I used the 15 inch big one to break free the jam nut after soaking with penetrating oil. Also the jam nut, the flat spot on outer tie rod, and inner tie rod are not precisely machined. The front lock nut that tightens the tie rod to keep it from coming out/moving is stuck so i can&#039;t lock the alignment in place. If perfect, the jam nut should not take more than 1/8 turn.</p>
